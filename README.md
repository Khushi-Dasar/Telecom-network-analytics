# 📊 Telecom Network Analytics

### Network Quality & Revenue Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes telecom network performance and customer usage data to identify revenue leakage, network congestion zones, and customer dissatisfaction patterns. It uses data analytics, visualization, and machine learning to recommend optimization strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze correlation between network QoS and ARPU
* Identify high complaint & low revenue regions
* Predict revenue decline risk using ML models
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses four datasets:

* **network_qos.csv** → Signal strength, latency, throughput, outages
* **revenue.csv** → ARPU and customer count by region
* **usage.csv** → Data usage, call minutes, dropped calls
* **complaints.csv** → Network complaints by region

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
* Power BI (Dashboard)
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* GitHub (Version Control)

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Integration (ETL)

* Merged all datasets using region
* Handled missing values
* Generated `network_master.csv`

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

* Correlation heatmap
* ARPU vs latency analysis
* Complaints trend by region
* Usage vs dissatisfaction patterns

### 3️⃣ Predictive Modeling

* Linear Regression → ARPU prediction
* Decision Tree → revenue risk classification
* Identified high-risk regions

### 4️⃣ Dashboard (Power BI)

Dashboard: **Network & Revenue Insights**

Includes:

* ARPU vs Latency scatter plot
* Complaints by region bar chart
* Throughput vs revenue analysis
* High-risk region identification

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* High latency leads to lower ARPU
* Complaints strongly correlate with revenue decline
* Low throughput regions show high dissatisfaction
* Network upgrades recommended in high-risk zones
